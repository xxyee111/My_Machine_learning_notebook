## 📖 Overview（概述）

This repository documents my systematic journey through **Andrew Ng's legendary Machine Learning course**. It's not just a collection of code, but a **commented, distilled, and visualized** knowledge base for myself and anyone who wants to understand the fundamentals deeply.

**这是经过我个人消化后添加了一些注释和可视化的知识库，记录了我的学习和作业过程**

## 🗺️ What's Inside?（里面有什么？）

- **🧠 Mind Maps & Notes**: Conceptual overviews for each module, breaking down complex theories into digestible chunks.
- **💻 Fully Annotated Code**: Line-by-line explanations of the original assignments. I dissect the *"why"* behind every operation.
- **🚀 My Experiments & Explorations**: Going beyond the course material by trying different parameters, models, or visualizations.

## 🎯 My Learning Objectives（我的学习目标）

-  Solidify understanding of core ML algorithms (Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, etc.)
-  Build a personal reference guide for future projects and interviews.
-  Practice scientific communication by writing clear comments and documentation.

## 📂 structure progress
-I will record my learning progress each week by module,from linear regression to decision-making tree.

## 🙏 Acknowledgement（致谢）

The original coursework is designed by the incredible [Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) and [Feng Du](https://github.com/fengdu78/Coursera-ML-AndrewNg-Notes). 
This repository is for **educational purposes** to deepen my understanding.
