## Overview（概述）

This repository documents my systematic journey through **Andrew Ng's legendary Machine Learning course**. It's not just a collection of code, but a **commented, distilled, visualized and automation** knowledge base for myself and anyone who wants to understand the fundamentals deeply.

**这是经过我个人消化后添加了一些注释和可视化的知识库，记录了我的学习和作业过程**

## What's Inside?（里面有什么？）

-  Mind Maps & Notes: Conceptual overviews for each module, breaking down complex theories into digestible chunks.
-  Fully Annotated Code: Line-by-line explanations of the original assignments. I dissect the *"why"* behind every operation.
-  My Experiments & Explorations: Going beyond the course material by trying different parameters, models, or visualizations.
-  The automated implementation process that I personally learned and added

## My Learning Objectives（我的学习目标）

-  Solidify understanding of core ML algorithms (Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, etc.)
-  Build a personal reference guide for future projects and interviews.
-  Practice scientific communication by writing clear comments and documentation.


## Acknowledgement（致谢）

The original coursework is designed by the incredible [Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) and [Feng Du](https://github.com/fengdu78/Coursera-ML-AndrewNg-Notes). 
This repository is for **educational purposes** to deepen my understanding.
